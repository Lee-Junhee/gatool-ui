                <p>gatool is a tool to provide <i><b>FIRSTÂ®</b></i> Game Announcers with up to date information while announcing events
                    during the <i><b>FIRST</b></i> Robotics season. As a web-based tool, it uses up-to-date information about the event to

                    laptops and tablet devices. In a pinch, it can be used on a mobile phone.</p>
