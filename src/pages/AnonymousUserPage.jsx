                        <p>gatool is a tool to provide <i><b>FIRSTÂ®</b></i> Game Announcers with up to date information while announcing events
                            during the <i><b>FIRST</b></i> Robotics season. As a web-based tool, it uses up-to-date information about the event to
                            provide a comprehensive set of useful data to Game Announcers. It is designed to work on desktops,
                            laptops and tablet devices. In a pinch, it can be used on a mobile phone.</p>
                        <p>You will need a login to
                            access the tool. All registered GAs and MCs will receive an invitation with a login and password. </p>
