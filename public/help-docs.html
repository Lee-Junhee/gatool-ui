            <h3>What is gatool?</h3>
            <p>gatool provides <i><b>FIRSTÂ®</b></i> Game Announcers with up to date information while announcing events
                during the <i><b>FIRST</b></i> Robotics season. As a web-based tool, it uses up-to-date information about the event to
                provide a comprehensive set of useful data to Game Announcers. It is designed to work on desktops,
                laptops and tablet devices. In a pinch, it can be used on a mobile device.</p>
            <p>gatool is available as a <a href="https://www.gatool.org">web site</a>. You will need a login to
                access the tool. See the <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/game-announcer">Game Announcer Resource Page</a> for details on how to register for an account.</p>
            <p>You can review the <i><b>FIRST</b></i> MC and GA resources <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/emcee-and-game-announcer-training-material">here.</a></p>
        </div>
        <div id="helpiPad" class="tab-pane fade helpSection">
            <h3>How do I make gatool full screen on my device?</h3>
            <p>In Safari on an iPad, you can save gatool to your home screen. In the address bar, tap the <strong>Share</strong>
                button and choose <strong>Add to Home Screen</strong>. </p>
            <p><img src="images/Add-to-home-screen.png" alt="Add to Home Screen on iPad" width="500px"></p>
            <p>This will add an icon on your iPad's home screen, and gatool will now behave like an app. <i>NOTE: The icon may
                    be whatever you have on the screen at the time you Add to Home Screen,</i> so you might want to have the
                Play by Play or Cheat Sheet screen open when you save. </p>
            <h3>Can I do the same on my desktop/laptop?</h3>
            <p>In Chrome and Safari on desktop/laptop computers, you can also save to your desktop. This will create an offline copy you can use in low bandwidth situations.</p>

            <h3>How do I use gatool?</h3>
            <p>gatool is organized in tabs. Each tab provides focused information to the user to help with specific
                aspects of a competition. The basic flow is:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Select your event</li>
                <li>Adjust team data by interviewing teams in the pits and around the competition</li>
                <li>Upload your new team data to the gatool Cloud (on-site GAs and MCs only, please, to avoid collision)
                </li>
                <li>Qualification Matches</li>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Announce teams</li>
                    <li>Call play-by-play</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Announce Alliance Selection</li>
                <li>Playoff Matches</li>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Announce teams</li>
                    <li>Call play-by-play</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Awards</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The ultimate goal of the gatool is to reduce paper and empower Game Announcers with more relevant and
                more up-to-date match data.</p>
                <p>We have included a Practice Event you can use to familiarize yourself with gatool. You can select it from the Event Menu on the Setup Page. It is split into four phases:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Practice Match Phase 1</b>: This simulates an event that is midway through Qualification matches. You will see scores for half of the Qualification matches, rankings for each team, and Alliance Selection is not ready.</li>
                    <li><b>Practice Match Phase 2</b>: This simulates an event that is half complete. You will see scores for all of the Qualification matches, rankings for each team, and Alliance Selection is ready. You can therefore try using our Alliance Selection tool on the Alliance Selection Screen.</li>
                    <li><b>Practice Match Phase 3</b>: This simulates an event that is half way through Playoffs. You will see scores for half of the Playoff matches, and the Playff Bracket shows results for the completed matches as well as teams assigned to future matches.</li>
                    <li><b>Practice Match Phase 4</b>: This simulates an event that is complete. You will see scores for all of the Playoff matches, and the Playoff Bracket is completely filled.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="images/practice-matches.png" alt="Practice Matches in the match Selection menu" width="650px">
            <p>If you are disinclined to read the documentation contained in this site, we've got an in-depth training video you can watch.</p>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YNqy7gKGzFU?si=FrAJj8CaBMhavTQi" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        </div>
        <div id="helpSetup" class="tab-pane fade helpSection">
            <h3>Setup</h3>
            <p>The Setup tab is where you select your event. Choose a year, then the event. You can filter the event list by timeframe or by event type, such as Regional or a specific District. You can type the name as well.</p>
            <p>The screen will display status information about the data that are available for the event. These data are read directly from <i><b>FIRST</b></i>, and they are updated throughout the competition by the Field Management System. As the event progresses, more data will be available and the status indicators will change.</p>
            <p>While event data load, the tabs at the top of the screen will change color. For instance, when a match schedule for the event is available, <strong>the Match Schedule </strong>tab will turn green. This is your clue that the match schedule is loaded and you are ready to go to work. Similarly, the <strong>Teams, Ranks</strong> and <strong>Awards</strong> tabs will turn green once the team list and rankings data become available, and <strong>Alliance Selection</strong> will turn green once Qualification matches complete.
            </p>
            <p>Once you complete Alliance Selection, return to this page to load the Playoff schedule by tapping or clicking the <strong>"Tap to refresh Schedule"</strong> button. The Playoff schedule changes as a result of match play and advancement criteria during Playoff stages, and updates will load automatically as the competition progresses. </p>
            <p>You can change whether and how gatool displays certain information in other screens. Adjust the switches to configure gatool to your specific tastes. You can make adjustments during an event, too. For instance, it is common to disable Sponsors on Announce once all teams have been introduced for the first time.</p>
            <p><img src="images/setup-controls.png" width="650px"></p>
            <p>On the right hand side are the commonly used configuration options. Here is a summary of how each option works:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Show Sponsors on Announce</strong>: when enabled, team Sponsors will appear on the Announce Screen. The default setting is enabled.</li>
                <li><strong>Show Awards on Announce</strong>: when enabled, team awards will appear on the Announce Screen. The default setting is enabled.</li>
                <li><strong>Show Notes on Announce & Play-By-Play</strong>: when enabled, team notes will appear on the Announce and Play-By-Play Screens. The default setting is enabled.</li>
                <li><strong>Show Mottoes on Announce & Play-By-Play</strong>: when enabled, team mottoes will appear on the Announce and Play-By-Play Screens. The default setting is enabled.</li>
                <li><strong>Show Champs Statistice on Announce in World and District Champs</strong>: when enabled, a team's lifetime statistics at World or District Champs will appear Announce Screen. The default setting is disabled.</li>
                <li><strong>Show Quals Statistics on Play-By-Play during Quals</strong>: when enabled, each team's Qualification performance stats will show on the Play-By-Play Screen when viewing a Qualification match. The default setting is enabled.</li>
                <li><strong>Show Quals Statistics on Play-By-Play during Playoffs</strong>: when enabled, each team's Qualification performance stats will show on the Play-By-Play Screen when viewing a Playoff match. The default setting is disabled.</li>
                <li><strong>Swap Play-By-Play Screen Orientation</strong>: when enabled, the Red and Blue Alliances will switch positions on the Play-By-Play Screen. This is to support games where the action occurs on the side of the field oppposite from the drivers' stations. The default setting is disabled.</li>
                <li><strong>Swap Emcee Screen Orientation</strong>: when enabled, the Red and Blue alliance hints will switch positions on the Emcee screen. This is to help the emcee more easily identify which team has the advantage in a playoff match. The default setting is disabled.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatically advance to the next match when loading the event</strong>: when enabled, gatool will read the completed matches from FMS and set your current match to the latest uncompleted match. The default setting is disabled.</li>
                <li><strong>For how many years should we display awards on the Announce Screen?</strong>: this menu sets the number of lookback years to include in our list of awards for each team. The default choice is three.</li>
                <li><strong>How many months before we consider a team's data to be stale?</strong>: this menu sets the number of months after which we consider a team's community-sourced updates to be stale. You can verify and update each team's specific details on the Team Data screen. The default choice is six months.</li>
                <li><strong>Enable Test Match Mode</strong>: when enabled, gatool will not use a schedule to determine which teams play in any given match. The Game Announcer can choose which teams will play directly on the Announce or Play-By-Play screens. This mode is to facilitate scenarios when you cannot connect to the Internet during an event, or for supporting Playoffs during offline events in the offseason. The default setting is disabled.</li>
                <li><strong>Set your time format</strong>: this menu sets the format for time display in the app. The default choice is 12 hr, which will include am and pm when displaying time.</li>
                <li><strong>Logout</strong>: use this button to log out of gatool. When you logout, your local changes will persist, so you can login later and your team data will still be here.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>At the bottom of the screen, there are two boxes with additional options, organized by function: <strong>Advanced Event Settings</strong> and <strong>Team Data Updates</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advanced Event Settings.</strong> These two menus adjust the flow of the playoffs in unusual scenarios. The first option sets the number of non-competing teams that may be included in your team list. This is a rare condition, but if it happens at your event, choose the number of teams that are on the team list that are not competing. The default choice is zero.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Update Team Data</strong> Use this to fetch updated community-sourced team data from gatool Cloud. gatool automatically loads communuty-sourced team data when you select an event, but if you are working with a partner and you are each entering data into gatool, you can each update half of the teams. When you are both done, you can then load each other's changes. NOTE: If you have unsaved local changes to team data, you will see a notice here asking whether you want to upload those changes to gatool Cloud. You can also discard those local changes.</li>
            </ul>

        </div>
        <div id="helpMatchSchedule" class="tab-pane fade helpSection">
            <h3>Match Schedule</h3>
            <p>The Match Schedule tab displays the match schedule data. This is up-to-date data from <i><b>FIRST</b></i>. You can always re-load the schedule from the Setup page. The Match Schedule is read only, and it will exapnd to include Playoff matches once they become available. The Match Schedule also shows match results as they become available. Red highlight indicates a Red Alliance win; Blue highlight indicates a Blue Alliance win; and Green highlight indicates a tie. On the left hand side of the table, it also shows predicted and actual match times to help you understand how close to on schedule your event is running.</p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolMatchSchedule.png" alt="gatool Match Schedule Screen." width="750"></p>
            <p>If you need to use gatool at an event that is not connected to the Internet, you can get a schedule report from your Scorekeeper as Excel and upload it here. For more details about the Offline event, see this short video. For playoffs, you'll need to load the initial Playoff schedule from your Scorekeeper and then reload as the rounds complete. Alternatively, you can use Test Match mode for playoffs.</p>

        </div>
        <div id="helpTeamData" class="tab-pane fade helpSection">
            <h3>Team Data</h3>
            <p>The Team Data tab displays information about the teams that are registered for the event. The table displays the current data from <i><b>FIRST</b></i>, but it allows you to modify what you see in the Announce and Play-by-play screens.</p>
            <p>You can also dowmload a spreadsheet containing the team details and schedule (when available). Tap on the link at the top of the table to download the team data and schedule. You can merge this with Word to create team data sheets you can hand out at an event. <a href="images/gatool_team_information_sheets.docx">Tap here to download the merge document (docx).</a> Note, the merge doc contains conditional merge tags. Do not edit the merged fields, as they will no longer work properly. Feel free to edit any other portion of the document.</p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolTeamData.png" width="750px" alt="Team Data page"></p>
            <p>Tap on a team number to open its details page. Edit any of the data in the form and tap <strong>Done</strong> to save the changes. These changes will appear in the <strong>Team Data</strong>, so if you want to revert any change to the <i><b>FIRST</b></i> data, simple clear the field in the details page and tap <strong>Done</strong>. If you want to erase ALL changes and revert to the data supplied by <i><b>FIRST</b></i>, reset the local storage from the Setup Screen.</p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolSortTeamTable.png" width="750px" alt="Team Data Sorting feature"></p>
            <p>When you make changes to a team's data, gatool records that as a "visit" to the team. Last visit times appear nder the team number, and the team number button will turn green if you have recorded a visit to a team. This can be very helpful as you work the pits. You must tap <strong>Done</strong> or <strong>Save Team Data to gatool Cloud</strong> to record a visit. Note that if you exit a Team Details page without recording a visit, no changes will be saved. You can reset all visit times by tapping on the <strong>Reset all visit times</strong> button at the bottom of the table.</p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolResetVisitTimes.png" width="750px" alt="Team Details visit times reset button">
            </p>
            <p>The Team Table is sortable. Tap on any column head to sort by that column. Once sorted, tapping again
                will reverse the sort order of that column.</p>
            <p>It is a best practice not to adjust the Awards field for a specific team. If you do, new Awards will not accrue to the teams whose Awards you edit. Instead, use the Awards controls on the Setup page. You can clear out all of the changes you have made to Awards, leaving all other changes intact, by tapping on the <strong>Reset stored awards </strong>button at the bottom of the Team Data screen. Note: it is a best practice to reset awards at the start of an event.</p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolTeamDataUpdate.png" width="750px" alt="Team Data details page"></p>
            <p>Any updated information is stored in the browser's local storage, so it should persist even if you close
                the browser or switch events. You can load crowd sourced team data by tapping on the <strong>Load Event Data from the gatool Cloud</strong> button on the Setup Screen.</p>
            <p>If you are a GA or MC at an event, please confer with your GA or MC partner, update your local team data,
                and then save it to the gatool Cloud. &nbsp;You can save to the gatool Cloud by tapping <strong>Save Event Data to the gatool Cloud</strong> on the Setup Screen. Once you have saved, you can load the data on another device so that all of your devices are synced. <strong><em>We ask that only the on-site GA or MC save to gatool cloud during an event.</em></strong></p>
        </div>
        <div id="helpAnnounce" class="tab-pane fade helpSection">
            <h3>Announce</h3>
            <p>Once you have interviewed the teams and have updated their robot names and sponsors (and other items, of
                course!) in your gatool, you are ready to announce. There are two screens for match announcing:
                <strong>Announce</strong>
                and <strong>Play-by-play.</strong>&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>The <strong>Announce Screen</strong> is organized to make it easy for you and your emcee to announce the
                teams before a match. The screen presents the teams in announce order, so you should be able to read
                from
                top to bottom. The current match is indicated at the top and bottom of the screen. Also, there are
                buttons
                to cycle through the matches. You can use these buttons to preview upcoming matches or to review
                previous
                matches. Each time you tap the <strong>Next Match</strong> or <strong>Previous Match</strong> buttons, a
                call is made to retrieve current ranking data. It is best to retrieve current ranking data right before
                your
                current match to fetch the latest results from <i><b>FIRST</b></i>. </p>
            <p>The Announce screen includes a lot of information about the teams, including:</p>
            <ul>

            <h3>Playoff features</h3>
            <p>During the Playoffs, you might need to substitute or rearrange teams in their stations. To replace a
                team,
                simply <strong>tap on a team number</strong>. Enter the replacement team number and tap <strong>Make it
                    so</strong>. The Announce and Play-by-play screens will now show data for the replacement team. The
                update will not affect other gatool users, nor will it update FMS. FMS will publish the match results
                with
                the substitutions after the match completes.</p>
            <p>You will not be allowed to substitute a team that does not appear in the event. </p>

            <h3>Play-by-play</h3>
            <p>The Play-by-play screen is organized to make it easy for you to provide colorful and relevant commentary
                during a match. The screen presents the teams from the perspective of the scoring table, with Blue
                Alliance on the left and Red Alliance on the right. The current match is indicated at the top of the
                screen. The
                tournament high score to date is indicated at the bottom of the screen. <strong>Note: </strong>The high
                score indicator is also a button that refreshes the current standings. </p>
            <p>At the top and bottom of the screen, there are buttons to cycle through the matches. You can use these
                buttons to preview upcoming matches or to review previous matches. Each time you tap the Next Match or
                Previous Match buttons, a call is made to retrieve current ranking data. It is best to refresh current
                match data right before your current match to ensure that you have the the latest results from FMS. </p>
            <p>The Announce screen includes a reduced set of information about the teams, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Team number</li>
                <li>Team Name</li>

                <li>Win-loss-tie record</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ranking is color coded to help build excitement and it follows the scheme from the Announce screen.</p>

            <p>At the top center of the screen, there is a match timer. This is a handy tool to help you identify the
                time remaining in the match and what phase of the match is currently active. Tap it once to start the
                timer,
                and tap it at any time to reset the timer. The phases of the timer include:</p>
            <p><strong>Autonomous. </strong>During the Autonomous period, the timer is orange and counts down to the end
                of Autonomous period.</p>
            <p><strong>Teleoperated. </strong>During the Teleoperated period, the timer is green and counts down to the
                Endgame, which begins when 30 seconds remain in the match.</p>
            <p><strong>Endgame. </strong>During the Endgame, the timer is red. When 10 seconds remain in the match, it
                will
                cycle alternatingly red and white until time expires.</p>

        <div id="helpAllianceSelection" class="tab-pane fade helpSection">
            <h3>Alliance Selection</h3>
            <p>The Alliance Selection Screen is designed to help you and your emcee inform and entertain during Alliance
                Selection. Often the most confusing part of any <i><b>FIRST</b></i> event, Alliance Selection is a critical component
                of
                the <i><b>FIRST</b></i> competition philosophy. In many venues, there is no clear view of the scoring screen, which
                can
                impede teams when making their Alliance partner choices. Also, it is difficult for a Game Announcer to
                search through a long list
                of teams in order to call out their names, schools and home towns after their number is called by the
                Alliance Captain.</p>
            <p>The Alliance Selection Screen uses a "tap on the team" interface to help ease the stress of Alliance
                Selection, and it is intended to be used by both emcees and Game Announcers. To ensure that you have the
                latest ranking data, tap on the high score on the Play-by-play Screen or by cycle backward and forward
                on
                the Announce or Play-by-play Screens. </p>
            <p>There is a status indicator that lets you know whether gatool believes it has the final rankings in order
                to proceed with Alliance Selection. Please be sure to review the rankings with your Scorekeeper before
                proceeding with Alliance Selection.</p>
            <p>All team numbers on the screen are active, so that when you tap them, you will have options based on
                whether
                the team is available for selection. As teams accept their invitations, the screen will adjust to
                reflect
                the decisions. If you make a mistake, you can always undo the choice.</p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolAlliance0.png" width="750px" alt="Alliance Selection"></p>
            <p>Alliance Captains are organized according to the ranking at the completion of Qualification play, and the
                Alliance Captains are pre-populated in their Alliances. The Alliances are on the right hand side of the
                screen. The current Alliance pick is also highlighted with a red border. Before Alliance Selection
                begins,
                it is customary to introduce the Alliance Captains. Tap on their team number to reveal their team
                particulars, then choose <strong>Alliance Captain Announce</strong> to dismiss the dialog.</p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolAlliance1.png" width="750px" alt="Alliance Selection"></p>
            <p>To make a selection, tap on a team number. A modal dialog will appear that displays the team number,
                name,
                hometown and organization. This is to help the Game Announcer provide details about the team as they
                come
                onto the field to accept of decline the offer to join the Alliance. If the accept the offer, tap
                <strong>Gratefully
                    Accept</strong>. If they decline the offer, tap <strong>Respectfully Decline</strong>.
            </p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolAlliance2.png" width="750px" alt="Alliance Selection"></p>
            <p>When a team accepts an offer, the folowing actions occur: they will be committed to the highlighted
                Alliance
                position, the team will be removed from the list of available teams, and the highlighted Alliance choice
                will advance to the next choice. If the invited team is in the top 8 of the remaining teams, they will
                move
                out of the green and pink boxes and move to the Alliance box. If they decline the offer, then select
                another
                team. If you make a mistake, you can undo the choice, all the way back to the beginning.</p>
            <p>Alliance Captains who have not yet chosen their first Alliance partner are also eligible for Alliance
                selection. If you tap an Alliance Captain, announce their particulars and choose <strong>Gratefully
                    Accept</strong> or <strong>Respectfully Decline</strong>. If they accept, their team will move to
                the
                highlighted Alliance choice, and all of the Captains below their rank will advance one slot. In
                addition, a
                new number 8 Captain will come out of the available alliance pool according to the qualification
                rankings. A
                new team will flow into the bottom of the green box, according to the qualification rankings.</p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolAlliance3.png" width="750px" alt="Alliance Selection"></p>
            <p>There is a special Championship case, in which Alliances contain 4 teams and there are no reserves.
                gatool
                understands this situation and will display a third choice for each Alliance. Since there are no backups
                in
                this situation, there is no Backup Alliance box in Championship Alliance Selection.</p>
            <p><img src="images/gatoolAlliance4.png" width="750px" alt="Alliance Selection" </p>
            <p>We have designed the
                Alliance Selection screen with simplicity and utility in mind. We hope that Emcees, Game
                Announcers and event coordinators will find it useful.</p>
